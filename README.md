## 🎯 Core Philosophy

- Strict tenant isolation (school-based)
- Strict academic session enforcement
- Clean service architecture
- Production-ready validation logic
- Premium UI/UX

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Backend
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Security (JWT)
- Hibernate + JPA
- OpenPDF
- H2 (Dev) → PostgreSQL (Planned)

### Frontend
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Context API for global UI state

## 🏗 Architecture

Controller → Service → Repository → Entity


Multi-tenancy:
- schoolId derived from JWT
- SUPER_ADMIN bypass supported
- No cross-tenant data exposure

Session isolation:
- Academic data filtered by sessionId
- StudentEnrollment is source of academic truth

### Simple model diagram (text)
School (currentSessionId)
  ├─ AcademicSession (active)
  ├─ User (role, active)
  ├─ Student
  │   ├─ StudentEnrollment (session scoped, active)
  │   ├─ PromotionRecord (source/target session,class)
  │   └─ StudentAttendance (session/date scoped)
  └─ Fee domain
      ├─ FeeType ──< FeeStructure ──1:1── LateFeePolicy
      ├─ StudentFeeAssignment (snapshot of structure + late fee policy + funding/discount effects)
      │    ├─ FeeAdjustment (discount/waiver snapshots)
      │    └─ LateFeeLog
      ├─ FeePayment (principal + late fee paid)
      └─ StudentFundingArrangement (session scoped, active)
